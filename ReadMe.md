# About

A minimalistic portfolio built with Tailwind CSS, Vite, Daisy UI & TypeScript.


## Challenges

This project posed the interesting challenge of structuring it in a clean, organized way while ensuring components were reusable.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port your Vite server runs on) in your browser.
